# SQL App Non-Split File Issue - RESOLVED

## Problem Summary
Non-split files (JSON and TXT) were not showing all Name and Vorname values from the Patient table. When generating non-split output files containing multiple patients' data, only the first patient's name appeared, while subsequent patients' names were missing or buried within the diagnosis data.

## Root Cause
The non-optimized format methods (`format_as_txt` and `format_as_json`) in `output_formatter.py` treated each database row independently without proper patient grouping, causing patient names to be lost or scattered throughout the output.

## Solution Implemented
Enhanced both `format_as_txt` and `format_as_json` methods with multi-patient detection and grouping logic:

### TXT Format Enhancements
- **Multi-patient detection**: Analyzes unique combinations of Name/Vorname fields
- **Patient grouping**: Groups patient info together, separated from diagnosis data  
- **Clear separators**: Uses "===" between patients and "---" between patient info and diagnoses
- **Backwards compatibility**: Preserves original simple format for single-patient data

### JSON Format Enhancements  
- **Structured output**: Creates separate `patient_info` and `records` sections for each patient
- **Proper grouping**: Patient data appears once per patient, followed by their diagnosis records
- **Maintained compatibility**: Single-patient scenarios continue to work as before

## Test Results
✅ **Multi-patient TXT**: Successfully groups patients with clear separators  
✅ **Multi-patient JSON**: Creates structured output with proper patient grouping  
✅ **Single-patient compatibility**: Original behavior preserved  
✅ **Non-patient data**: Handles data without Name/Vorname fields correctly  
✅ **Edge cases**: Empty data and partial patient info handled gracefully  

## Files Modified
- `tbase_extractor/sql_interface/output_formatter.py` (Enhanced `format_as_txt` and `format_as_json` methods)

## Test Files Created
- `test_non_optimized_format.py` - Comprehensive test suite
- `test_results_output.txt` - Documented test results
- `test_edge_cases.py` - Edge case testing

## Status: RESOLVED ✅
The issue has been successfully fixed. Non-split files now properly display all patient names and organize multi-patient data in a clear, readable format while maintaining backwards compatibility with existing functionality.
